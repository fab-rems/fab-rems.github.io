## **It started with #FAB100.**

If you’re here, you may already know that **#FAB100** isn’t just any beer. But just so we’re on the same page, I can break it down for you.

**#FAB100** is...

- ….a **splendiferous example** of an **unconventional style** of beer: Strawberry Milkshake New England IPAs (🍓🎂🍺). It’s basically a strawberry cake transmogrified into fizzy beer form, and it’s fantastic. We’re happy so many beer lovers out there have taken the time to express the same! Thanks, y'all!
- ...a **100-day anniversary beer** for us here at FAB! Sure, turns out we started a brewing company just in time for a pandemic, but, hey, we’ve made some good beer, and we’re proud of our work. We’re also proud of the artists we work with, and just look at that can art! The **#FAB100** can is rocking the work of Andy Jacob ([@soulkontroller](https://www.instagram.com/soulkontroller/)) and Septic ([@septictheoutlaw](https://www.instagram.com/septictheoutlaw/)) by the way - much love, and beware the Shoggoth 👾.

Happy anniversary to us! (That's real strawberry cake, fyi.)

- ...a **full-on COVID-19 relief effort engine**. Ill-content to sit by and do nothing while medical workers put themselves at risk to tackle COVID-19, FAB partnered with **[Artisan’s Asylum](https://artisansasylum.com/)** - whose makers have come together to address the lack of needed medical supplies - and pledged **#FAB100’s** profits to their cause. Already, sales from **#FAB100** raised **$15,000** for Artisan’s, helping to ensure the continuance of their incredibly impressive PPE manufacturing efforts.

In sum, we think **#FAB100** **has been a** **true success**! A **win-win-win**, really: a great beer benefiting an important mission while being sold through local businesses during a trying time. And, of course, this is all made possible by people like **YOU**, who have been buying and enjoying our beer. So hey, thanks!

## **Which brings us to #FAB200.**

#FAB100 didn’t just exceed our expectations, *it inspired us*. Good beer is great, but a beer that *does* good? That’s something else. We always knew we wanted out beer to do more - hence our motto, “beer for art’s sake.” But why stop at art when there are so many important causes our beer can benefit?

**Enter #FAB200**. A new beer and a new benefit. But what is #FAB200 exactly? Well, we’re curious about that too. We know it’s gotta be special, we know it’s gotta be good, and we know we’d love it if it were a tad unconventional, but we don’t know what YOU know.

In the spirit of inclusivity and getting to know you better, we ask you, squidheads and others: What new beer would you like to try? Funky ingredients, unprecedented combinations of hops and yeasts, forbidden tastes? And what or who can this new beer help? We know that there are many worthy causes and scrappy organizations out there, but we want to know who you think could really use some love.

Please, won’t you let us know: fab.beer/sticky
